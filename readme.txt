In this project, I explored the sales patterns in a region's supermarkets and uncovered some fascinating insights:

🔍 **Data Preprocessing:** Checked for missing data and removed unnecessary columns.  
📊 **Visualization:** Used Seaborn to create visualizations, revealing that men mostly shopped in the food and beverage category, while women preferred health and beauty. The top categories were fashion accessories and food and beverages.  
🏙️ **Top City:** Naypyitaw emerged as the city with the most sales!

After visualizing, I split the data into train and test sets and scaled the data using Standard Scaler and One Hot Encoder.

🧠 **Machine Learning Models:**
- Linear Regression
- Lasso
- Ridge
- K-Neighbors Regressor
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest Regressor
- AdaBoost Regressor

I evaluated the models using the R2 score and compiled the results in a comparison table. 📈

This project was a great learning experience, and I'm excited to continue exploring the world of data science! 🌟
